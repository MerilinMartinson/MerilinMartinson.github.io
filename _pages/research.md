I work on applied micro topics with an emphasis on labour and migration economics. I like problems that combine rich administrative data with careful causal identification.

## Areas of interest

- Labour market integration and mobility  
- Migration decisions and policy impacts  
- Inequality, education, and skills  
- Program evaluation and causal inference

## Current projects

- Job market paper on labour/migration economics — abstracts and draft available on request.  
- Additional projects using large administrative datasets; summaries coming soon.

If you’d like to hear more about a project or collaborate, [send me an email](mailto:merilin.martinson@gmail.com).

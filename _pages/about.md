Hi, I’m Merilin — a PhD candidate in Economics at UCL, currently based in Berlin.  
I study labour and migration questions using a mix of applied econometrics and data science.

**Interests**: labour markets, migration and integration, policy evaluation, and inequality.  
**Methods**: causal inference, linked administrative data, and reproducible research workflows.  
**Tools**: R, Python, Stata; version control and transparent documentation.

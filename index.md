I am a PhD candidate in Economics at UCL, working on applied micro questions with a focus on labour and migration.  
Based in Berlin; open to collaborations that involve large datasets and careful identification.

## Research focus

- Labour markets, migration, and integration outcomes.  
- Applied econometrics: causal inference, program evaluation, and linked administrative data.  
- Data-heavy workflows: reproducibility, version control, and transparent documentation.

## Current projects

- Job market paper in labour/migration economics (details and draft available on request).  
- Additional projects exploring administrative data; abstracts coming soon.

## Teaching snapshot

- *Business Mathematics*, HTW Berlin (2018–2020): matrix algebra, linear systems, calculus, optimisation.  
- *Research Methods and Scientific Writing*, HTW Berlin (2018–2020).  
- *Primary & Kindergarten Teaching*, Colombia (2016–2018): English and Mathematics with student‑centred methods.
